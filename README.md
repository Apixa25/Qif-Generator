Group project 1
USER STORY:
AS A USER I AM LOOKING TO EXPAND MY VOCABULARRY AND HAVE SOME FUN

ACCEPTANCE STORY:
GIVEN A WORD GENERATOR WHEN I INPUT MY CRITERIA THEN I AM GIVEN A WORD BASED OFF OF THAT CRITERIA

WHEN I AM GIVEN THAT WORD THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH ADDITIONAL CRITERIA

WHEN I AM GIVEN MY GIF CRITERIA THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH A RANDOMLY GENERATED GIF

- PSEUDOCODE:

- WHEN THE USER HITS THE PAGE THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH A TEXT FIELD FOR THEM TO ENTER THEIR FAVORITE WORD.
- IF THEY PUT IN THEIR NAME THEY CAN MAKE THE QUOTE CUTOM TO THEM: I.E. "GREETINGS X!"
- WHEN THEY HIT SUBMIT IT WILL RANDOMLY GENERATE A QUOTE FOR THEM BASED OFF THEIR INPUT WORD.
- ALSO WHEN THEY HIT SUBMIT THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH A RANDOMLY GENERATED GIF.

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* GOING TO USE TAILWIND FOR CSS
Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* DONE
Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
* WE HAVE ONE DATA POINT! ENTER A "WORD" MAYBE LATER AD "NAME"
Use at least two server-side APIs.
* QUOTE API AND GIFY API
Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* OK - THINK OF DOING A MODAL TO SOCIAL MEDIA
Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* MAYBE KEEP THEIR NAME, OR WORD THAT THEY GENERATED
Be responsive.
* MAKE SURE TO USE TAILWIND PROPERTIES TO MAKE IT MOBILE FRIENDLY
  * OUR INTENTION IS TO USE THE LAYOUT AND PROPERTIES FROM THE WEATHER DASHBOARD
Have a polished UI.
* GOING TO USE TAILWIND PROPERTIES TO MAKE SURE ITS POLLISHED 
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW ONE SET OF HANDS ON THE CODE AT A TIME, WE WILL REVIEW OUR ASSETS AND FILE NAMES 
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
* FUNCTIONS SHOULD ALWAYS BE NAMED BY VERBS, STATIC ITEMS SHOULD BE A NOUN 
  * WE WILL USE THE FORMAT OF OUR PREVIOUS README'S 

ACTION ITEMS:
- LAYOUT THE HTML FOR OUR APP USING TAILWIND
    - LINKING TO TAILWIND CSS IN OUR HEADER
    - IN THE HTML LINK TO THE SCRIPT USING VUE
    - MIMIC THE BOOTSTRAP CLASSES AND TURN THEM INTO TAILWIND

- JAVASCRIPT = USE AS MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS AS POSSIBLY FROM WHAT WE DID IN OUR WEATHER APP, 
        ASK OURSELVES: HOW CAN I TURN THIS INTO VUE.JS?

- API STUFF = NEED TO BE ABLE TO:
    FETCH THE DATA - WHAT DATA? FETCH A QUOTE BASED OFF THE WORD INPUT, THE WORD IS THE CATEGORY 
    VIEW THE DATA = THIS IS THE "RESPONSE" FROM THE API TO US (THIS IS FOR US, NOT THE USER)
    DIPLAY THE DATA = THIS IS THE INERHTML PORITON = THIS IS THE PART THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES
