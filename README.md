## Description:
Our web-based application generates a quote and a giphy image by selecting the word of your choice. The user is presented with a drop-down box for their word and an ‚ÄúAdd Word‚Äù button. Upon adding the word, a random quote and gif image will display based off of the word selected. The word will then be saved for the user to click as many times as they desire, each time refreshing with a new quote and gif image. The user is also able to click the ‚ÄúClear Words‚Äù button to remove all their previously added words. For this project we used Zenquotes.io and giphy.com.<br />
<br />

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Working with Tailwind
We learned different classes in Tailwind and how to properly use them to affect our layout. We took lessons from learning Boostrap and reverse engineered some terms to find what we needed. We also consulted the documentation, which was very helpful.

#### 2. Working with granim
We learned how to create a gradient background using granim. We were reminded on the z-index during this part of the project. For this tool we had to utilize JS, CSS, and HTML to implement.

#### 3. Working with new server-side API's
We learned how to use queries and review them in the browser. Through reviewing them we could determine if they would be a good API for us in our project. Additionally we utilized the console.log frequently to test the fetch response to determine exactly how we could implement the data.

Figuring out how to assign people to certain tasks, what are valuable tasks to put on the board, and how often to review the tasks together.

#### Synopsis
We learned how to work with professional tools and professionally within a group. We also learned how to effectively work with different API'S and frameworks other than ones covered in our classes. This was a great opportunity for us to bring together all the skills we learned in the first three weeks of the course.
